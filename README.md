FoodApp is a simple Android application that demonstrates the usage of modern Android development tools and practices. This project follows the principles of Clean Architecture and MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern. It uses Dagger Hilt for dependency injection, Retrofit for network operations, and Jetpack Compose for the UI.

## Features

- Fetch meals data from a remote API
- Clean Architecture
- MVVM pattern
- Dependency Injection with Dagger Hilt
- Network operations with Retrofit
- Modern UI with Jetpack Compose

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Kotlin
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture
- **Design Pattern**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **Dependency Injection**: Dagger Hilt
- **Networking**: Retrofit
- **UI**: Jetpack Compose

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abdurashidovvv/FoodApp.git
    ```

2. **Open the project in Android Studio**:
    - Open Android Studio
    - Select "Open an existing project"
    - Navigate to the cloned repository and open it

3. **Build the project**:

    - Select "Run 'app'"

## Architecture Overview

This project is organized following the Clean Architecture principles. The codebase is divided into three main layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Contains the UI components and the ViewModel. This layer is responsible for displaying data and handling user interactions.

2. **Domain Layer**: Contains the business logic of the application. This layer is independent of any framework or library.

3. **Data Layer**: Handles data operations and provides data to the domain layer. This includes network operations using Retrofit and local database operations.

## Modules

- **app**: Contains the Android application class and dependency injection setup.
- **presentation**: Contains the UI components built with Jetpack Compose and ViewModels.
- **domain**: Contains the use cases and repository interfaces.
- **data**: Contains the repository implementations and network setup with Retrofit.
